# About Me

Data Science Student at ITAM and currently working for Servicast (Cybersecurity services). 
My main interests are in the fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Cybersecurity and I am always looking for new projects to work on.

This page is dedicated to my personal projects and some of the work I have done in the past. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
